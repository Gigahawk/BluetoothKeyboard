# BluetoothKeyboard

My poor attempt at getting the (terribly restrictive) [HobbyTronics USB Host module](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/usb-host-keyboard) with an [Adafruit Bluefruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-bluefruit-le/overview) to act as a USB Keyboard to Bluetooth Converter like a [Nulaxy](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/keyboard-mouse-bluetooth-adapter#/) or a [HandheldSci Bluetooth Keyboard Adapter](http://handheldsci.com/kb)
